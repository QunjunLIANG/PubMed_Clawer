# PubMed_Crawler
A R-based Crawler which could extract the paper titles and journal names from PubMed.

I wrote this script for checking the publish of our group. But I decided to git it when I realized it could be helpful for PhD applicants to know their ideal superviors and those who are struggling with meta-analysis.

# The features of PubMed_Crawler
1. It allows you to input keywords in Rstudio instead of approaching the pubmed website to start your search.
2. PubMed_Crawler collects the paper titles, journal names and publish Date, then write them down into a CSV file.
3. PubMed_Crawler also does some visualization, which use wordcloud to show the frequency of journal names.

# Notes before using
1. PubMed_Crawler requires *[selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)* to control the browser, please make sure selenium has been install properly in your OS.
2. PubMed_Crawler also needs the java environment to run rJAVA.
3. PubMed_Crawler uses the GUI in Rstudio, so do not run PubMed_Crawler with other IDEs.
4. PubMed_Crawler just be tested on windows 10 platform.
